# Gotem - a simple HTML template tool #

Gotem is a very simple static HTML template tool. It allows you to
include other files in your HTML document. For example, you might have
a common header, footer and menu that you want to include on every
page. Gotem allows you to put these elements in their own files, and
then include them from another file.

## Usage ##

Put all of the elements to include into the same directory, containing
one file for each element ending in `.template`. For example, you
could create a directory called `includes`, and then create a file in
there called `html_start.template` containing:

    <html>
    <body>

And a file called `html_end.template` in the same directory containing:

    </body>
    </html>

Then create your main HTML document in a file called `index.template`
containing:

    {{include "html_start"}}
    <h1>My HTML contents goes here</h1>
    {{include "html_end"}}

Then you can compile the page to `index.html` by running:

    gotem -I includes index.template index.html

And that's it.

If the output file is missing or `-` then the compiled HTML file will
be printed to stdout. If the input file is missing or `-` then the
template will be read from stdin. You can run gotem without `-I` but
then you won't be able to include anything, so it might be kinda
pointless.

(Behind the scenes, gotem uses Go's templating system so maybe you can
do something fancier with the templates.)

## Installing ##

Binaries for Mac and Linux are available from the
[releases page](https://github.com/jcinnamond/gotem/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
